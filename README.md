# DEV5-myportfolio

Hi! My name is Jarno, i'm a novice programmer looking to broaden his horizon and create some damn cool projects in the meantime

1. ðŸ¤“ I'm a graphic design and progamming student (full-time) and wannabe fantasy author during my spare time
2. ðŸ’» When i'm not behind a screen working on a website or writing a story I'm either polishing up my dart skill or trying not to set the kitchen on fire while whipping up a new dish
